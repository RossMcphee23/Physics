# Physics
-> In this code I used the RK4 method, which is an numerical method to solve differential equations, I opted to use RK4 but RK1 would not have really changed much.

-> Note that I dont look at impact with ground, and use of conservation of energy here, rather I was more interested in the difference of the times taken when air resistence was and wasnt considered.
